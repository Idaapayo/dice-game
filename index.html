      <h2>About Game</h2>
      <p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945.[1] As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice,[2] and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.
Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". For jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains. </p>
